                        industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of

                        and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also
                        the
                        leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the
